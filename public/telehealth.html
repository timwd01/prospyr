                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">By using our services, you acknowledge that you have read, accept, and agree to be bound by this Consent and that this acceptance constitutes a legal signature. You also affirm that you will provide accurate and complete information to the best of your knowledge.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Purpose</h2>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">The purpose of this Consent form ("Consent") is to provide you with information about telehealth and to obtain your informed consent to the use of telehealth in the delivery of healthcare services to you. Practice-engaged providers, including physicians and other providers employed by or otherwise engaged to provide services for or on behalf of a Practice are referred to collectively herein as "Providers."</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Nature of Telehealth Services</h2>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Telemedicine is the use of electronic communications to enable health care providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. The information may be used to determine eligibility for a prescription and, where indicated, to provide such prescription.</p>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">Telehealth services offered by National Weight Loss Clinic may include a patient consultation, evaluation, diagnosis, treatment recommendation, prescription, and/or a referral, as determined clinically appropriate by the Practice and Provider (the "Services").</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Possible Benefits of Telehealth</h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                        <li>Improved access to medical care</li>
                        <li>More efficient medical evaluation and management</li>
                        <li>Possibility of selecting a time that is convenient to you</li>
                        <li>Possibility to choose a location that is convenient for you</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Possible Risks of Telehealth</h2>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">There are potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. These risks include, but may not be limited to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                        <li>Information transmitted may not be sufficient to allow for appropriate medical decision-making by the provider</li>
                        <li>Provider may not be able to provide medical treatment for your particular conditions</li>
                        <li>Regulatory requirements may limit your Provider's ability to provide treatment options</li>
                        <li>Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures in technology equipment or Provider availability</li>
                        <li>Security protocols could fail, resulting in privacy breaches of personal medical information</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Service Limitations</h2>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Telehealth Providers are unable to have direct, physical contact with the patient. As a result, some clinical needs may not be appropriate for a telehealth visit and your Provider will make that determination. Your Provider's determination regarding the appropriateness of telehealth care is their sole and absolute discretion and may not be appealed.</p>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4"><strong>Providers do not address medical emergencies.</strong> If you believe you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should dial 9-1-1 and/or go to the nearest emergency room. After receiving emergency healthcare treatment, you should visit your local primary care provider.</p>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">If you are not experiencing an emergency or do not require immediate or urgent care, you can communicate with our team via text, call, or email.</p>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">Our Providers are not a replacement for your local primary care provider. Responsibility for your overall medical care should remain with your local primary care provider. We strongly encourage you to locate one if you do not already have one.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">We prioritize your privacy and maintain the confidentiality of your medical information in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law. However, please note that the security of electronic communication cannot be guaranteed, and there are risks associated with the transmission of data.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Patient Agreements</h2>
                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">As a patient utilizing telehealth services and by using our services, you agree as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                        <li>You have read and understand the information provided above regarding the benefits and risks of telehealth.</li>
                        <li>You give your informed consent to the use of telehealth by Providers hereunder.</li>
                        <li>If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you will dial 9-1-1 immediately, you will not seek emergency or urgent care or treatment from National Weight Loss Clinic.</li>
                        <li>There is no guarantee that you will be treated by a Provider. Your Provider reserves the right to deny care for potential misuse of the Services or for any other reason. If, in the professional judgment of your Provider, the provision of the Services is not medically or ethically appropriate, you may be denied treatment. There is no guarantee that you will be issued a prescription, and the decision of whether a prescription is appropriate will be made in the professional judgment of your Provider.</li>
                        <li>You understand that no results from telehealth services can be guaranteed or assured.</li>
                        <li>You understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality of medical information also apply to telehealth.</li>
                        <li>You understand that all medical reports resulting from the telehealth visit are part of your medical record.</li>
                        <li>You hereby release and hold harmless National Weight Loss Clinic and each Provider from damage or loss arising from or in connection with the loss or misappropriation of data or information arising out of the telehealth service.</li>
                        <li>There is a risk of technical failures during the telehealth visit beyond the control of your Providers.</li>
                    </ul>
